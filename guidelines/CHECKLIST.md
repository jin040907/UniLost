## 📝 Notes

### Before Uploading to GitHub

1. **Verify Database File Exclusion**
   - `unilost.db` is automatically excluded because it's included in `.gitignore`. ✅

2. **Environment Variable Settings**
   - The `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable must be set during deployment.
   - This is automatically generated by Render.

3. **Default Account Information**
   - The default accounts are for development purposes. Changing them in production is recommended.
   - **Student Accounts**: `student1` ~ `student10` / `1234`
   - **Administrator Accounts**: `admin1` ~ `admin10` / `admin123`

### Post-Upload Checklist

- [ ] Verify that all files have been uploaded to the GitHub repository
- [ ] Verify that the `.db` file has been excluded
- [ ] Verify that `node_modules` has been excluded
